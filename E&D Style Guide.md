</aside>

This guideline, in short, is VTEX's interpretation of stylistics as a discipline and explains particular choices in the use of language when creating functional and technical content about the VTEX platform.

<img src="E&D%20Style%20Guide%2080cf41f627574419bde54e64aa04d1df/Alert2.png" alt="E&D%20Style%20Guide%2080cf41f627574419bde54e64aa04d1df/Alert2.png" width="40px" /> This guide is intended as a best-practice document for tech writers contributing to content creation at VTEX. It is not a regulation. It must be used as a reference to improve the content.

</aside>

Technical writing is not inventing "rules" out of the blue but choosing existing "rules" that best fit our declaration concerning linguistics and the particular variety of language used by VTEX technical writers.

Every guideline herein pertains to a determined language study field/discipline. Technical writing thus requires a strong foundation in general writing. The process is iterative and involves multiple reviews and revisions before publication.

## Reference Hierarchy

When creating content, use the following references in this order.

## Editorial Guidelines

### 1. Word emphasis

#### 1.2. Italic

The italic type formatting should be used in the following cases:

- To draw attention to a specific word or phrase, such as when using words like "word."

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | In this circumstance, use the word *product*. | In this circumstance, use the word product. |

- To Italicize mathematical variables and version variables.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | In version 1.4.*x*, you can consider *x + y* = 3. | In version 1.4.x, you can consider x + y = 3. |

#### 1.3. Underline

- Do not use underline. The underline is exclusively reserved for linking.

### 2. Numbers and Currency

#### 2.1. Numbers

- In general, spell out the following:
    - Ordinal numbers.
    - Numbers from zero to nine.
    - With thousand, million, billion, and trillion, use the mixed form if numbers are round or approximate.
    - Indefinite and casual numbers.

    - Numbers at the beginning of a sentence.

- In general, use numerals for:
    - Numbers equal to or greater than 10
    - Measurements
    - Percentages
    - Dimensions
    - Decimals
    - Negative numbers
    - Fractions

- Use the three-letter ISO 4217 code for currencies.
- Include the dollar sign ($) at the beginning of the currency.
- Do not add space between the symbol and value.
- Use commas for thousands separators and periods for decimals in USD.

### 3. Capitalization

#### 3.1. Sentence case

- Use sentence case for titles, headings, lists, and table elements.
- The first word after a colon should not start with a capital letter.

#### 3.2. All-uppercase

Should only be used for:
- Official names
- Abbreviations that are always written in all-caps
- Codes that use all-caps

- Captions
- Labels
- Callouts
- Text in images and diagrams

### 4. Headings and titles

- Your heading or title must be descriptive, as short as possible, and generally convey only one main action.
- Make the learning objective of the article clear, preferably with only one verb.
- Use sentence case.
- Do not use punctuation at the end.
- Do not use bold or italics.
- Avoid using code items.
- Do not skip levels of the heading hierarchy.
- Preferably start with a verb in infinitive form or a noun. Verbs in the imperative should be used mainly in a sequence of steps.
- When using an abbreviation in a heading or title, spell out the abbreviation in the first paragraph that follows the heading or title.
- Do not use highlight expressions and generic words for headings and titles, such as *attention, details, important observations,* and *examples.*

### 5. Links

#### 5.1. Structuring link text

To write effective link text, use one of the following forms:

- Make the link text match the exact text of the title or heading that you're referencing.
- Write a description of the destination page to use as the link text, capitalized as if it's part of the sentence.
- Isolated words should not work as links except when referring to a concept or definition.

#### 5.2. Writing link text

- When you write a complete sentence that refers to another topic, introduce the link with the phrase *For more information, see* or *For more information about..., see*.
- Write unique, descriptive link text that makes sense without the surrounding text. Don't use phrases like *click here* or *this document*.
- If the link text doesn't clearly indicate why you're referring the reader to this information, then give an explanation.
- If a link downloads a file, write link text that indicates this action as well as the file type.
- If the text includes an abbreviation in parentheses, include the long form and the abbreviation in the link text.
- When linking content in the Help Center, use the correct route taking into consideration the article's language.
- If you're linking to a document outside VTEX, be explicit about who it belongs to.
- Do not provide duplicate links to the same document within a given page, except in specific cases.

#### 5.3. Punctuation with links

- If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags.

### 6. Procedures

#### 6.1. Introductory sentences

- In general, introduce a procedure with an introductory sentence to provide context.
- You can introduce a procedure with an imperative statement.
- The sentence can end with a colon or a period.

#### 6.2. Content

- Each line of the procedure must correspond to an action to be taken by the user.
- Do not use steps exclusively to explain concepts.
- Do not skip steps or assume user familiarity.
- Consider splitting long steps or combining small actions.
- Keep verbal tense consistent across topics.
- State the purpose and location before declaring the action.
- Document the most accessible procedure when multiple options exist.
- Mark optional steps with "Optional:" at the beginning.
- Avoid directional language like "above" or "below".
- Reproduce UI text exactly as it appears in the Admin.

#### 6.3. Sub-steps in numbered procedures

- Use letters for sub-steps and Roman numerals for sub-sub-steps.
- Use bullets for non-sequential sub-steps.
- End punctuation can be a colon or period based on context.

#### 6.4. Formatting

- Maintain continuous numbering in procedures.
- Be careful with breaks between steps to avoid accidental list restarts.

### 7. Lists and Tables

Tables and lists are both ways to present a set of similarly structured items. Sometimes it's not obvious when to choose one over the other. 

- If each item is a single unit, use a list. Don't make one-column tables.
- Do not use tables to lay out long one-dimensional lists in multiple columns.
- If each item is a pair of related data, you can choose between a table or a list.
- When you have long descriptions or too many breaks, a list would be preferable.
- Avoid tables in the middle of a numbered procedure.
- Use a table if each item has three or more related data.

#### 7.1. Lists

Lists help organize the content and facilitate understanding. When you need to roll items that do not configure a sequence of steps, it could be helpful to format it as a list.

##### 7.1.1. Introductory sentences

- Like introductory sentences for procedures, precede a list with an opening sentence for context.
- The sentence can end with a colon or a period.
- Using the word *following* and a colon at the end is often a good choice.

##### 7.1.2. Bulleted list

- Use bullet lists for items with no particular order.
- Use bullet lists for terms or phrases with descriptions, using bold formatting for concept names.
- Bulleted lists can be used as sub-steps in numbered procedures.

##### 7.1.3. Parallelism

Lists should maintain parallel structure in:
- Syntax
- Grammar
- Logical category
- Capitalization
- Punctuation

##### 7.1.4. Punctuation

The punctuation at the end of each item depends on the content:
- Generally end with periods, except for:
  - Single word/expression items
  - Lists without verbs
  - Lists of codes, links, or document titles
- Use consistent punctuation for explanatory phrases

#### 7.2. Tables

- Tables must have an introductory sentence describing their purpose.
- Refer to tables using phrases like "the following table" or "the preceding table."
- The introductory sentence must be complete and can end with a colon or period.
- Use a colon if the table follows immediately, a period if there's intervening content.

### 8. Computer interfaces

#### 8.1. Placeholders

- We often need to refer to information that should be input by the user. A common case is URL variables. We represent these variables with placeholders contained in a pair of curly brackets.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | {accountName}.myvtex.com/admin | accountName.myvtex.com/admin |
    |  | {{accountName}}.myvtex.com/admin |

- When mentioning a placeholder in a flowing text, format it as code without the curly brackets.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | The `accountName` should be replaced with the name of your store account. | The `{accountName}` should be replaced with the name of your store account. |

#### 8.2. Button names

- When referring to names for buttons in a list or numbered procedure or bulleted list, format the button name as code.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1. In the **Marketplace** module, click on `Integrations`.
    2. On the **Google Shopping** card, click on `Integrate`.
    3. Then click on `Save configuration`. | 1. In the **`Marketplace`** module, click on **Integrations**.
    2. On the *Google Shopping* card, click on *Integrate*.
    3. Then click on "Save configuration". |

- In a flowing text, when referring to a sequence that involves UI elements with angle brackets, you must use bold format.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | You will have to access the Admin page, and in the **Products** module click on **Store Setup** *>* **inStore** *>* **Customer Identification***.* | You will have to access the Admin page, and in the **Products** module click on `Store Setup *>* inStore *>* Customer Identification`*.* |

#### 8.3. Icons

- When including icons in your text, remember to include a label describing it to improve accessibility. Prefer adding the icon after the label.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Click on the search 🔍  button. | Click on the magnifying glass button. |
    |  | Click on the 🔍 search button. |
    |  | Click on the magnifying glass 🔍 button. |

- Screen readers might be interrupted by inline icons, meaning they don't finish the sentence. Include the attribute `"aria-hidden"=true` so that screen readers ignore the inline icon html tag.

    | ✅ **Dos** | ❌ **Don'ts** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Click on the search <i class="fas fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></i> button. | Click on the search <i class="fas fa-search"></i> button. |

### 9. Callouts

Callouts highlight information or notify about something. There are four main categories:

- Callout in flowing text
- Beta phase
- Exclusive content
- Content under translation

#### 9.1. Callout in flowing text

- There are three kinds of callouts to highlight information in the middle of your text:
    - ℹ️ **Information:** use it to give additional information about the subject or to highlight an aspect the user should pay attention to.
    - ⚠️ **Caution:** use it when the user must pay attention to information to avoid issues or unexpected behaviors.
    - ⛔ **Danger:** use it to represent the highest criticality level.

- General rules for all callouts:
    - Do not start a text with a callout (except for beta phase warnings)
    - Do not use callouts too close together
    - Keep callouts concise (ideally under four lines)
    - Do not use images inside callouts
    - Do not start with words like "attention" or "observation"

#### 9.2. Beta phase

- Use beta phase warnings at the beginning of articles about products in beta
- This is the only case where starting with a callout is allowed

#### 9.3. Exclusive content

- Use exclusive content notifications when content is region-specific
- Include appropriate language-specific messages for content not applicable to certain regions

#### 9.4. Content Under Translation

- Use pending translation notes when content is published in only one or two languages initially
- Ensure the need for localization is appropriate before using these notices

#### 9.5. Formatting callouts

- Callouts use HTML `<div>` tags with Bootstrap CSS classes
- For text formatting inside callouts, use HTML tags:
  - Bold: `<strong>text</strong>`
  - Italic: `<em>text</em>`
  - Links: `<a href="URL">link text</a>`

### 10. Learn more section

When you want to recommend related articles to the user, you can format it as a learn more section. You can do it two ways: in the middle of your text or at its end.

#### 10.1. Learn more section in the middle of the text

You should not organize additional content as a separate section if your text already has too many breaks, such as callouts and lists. If adding a break and increasing the visual text dynamic is desirable, organize additional content as a separate section.

#### 10.2. Learn more section at the end of the text

- If you write a paragraph to refer to additional content, organize it as a separate section.
- When formatting related links in a bulleted list:
    - Present at least three links and no more than six
    - Do not add any paragraph before the list
- The *Learn more* section formatted as a bulleted list is the only case where you will find a heading in bold and jump through the headings hierarchy.

#### 10.3. Documenting Design Systems

- Use italics in scenarios where quotes would be used, such as for labels
- Use bold only at the start of list items for terms being defined and followed by a colon
- Avoid parentheses, personal pronouns, and mentions to *users*

## Announcement Framework

### Goals

The announcement framework aims to help you build user documentation that is:

- **Clear**: Easy to understand and follow
- **Suitable**: Appropriate for the target audience
- **Precise**: Accurate and specific

Organize the content in a logical flow:
1. What's changing
2. When it's changing
3. How it affects users
4. What actions users need to take

#### Call to action

End with clear next steps or actions required from the reader.
