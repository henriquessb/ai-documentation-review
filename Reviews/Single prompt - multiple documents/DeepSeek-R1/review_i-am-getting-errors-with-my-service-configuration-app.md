# Technical Documentation Review: i-am-getting-errors-with-my-service-configuration-app.md  

## Summary  

The document effectively troubleshoots service configuration errors with clear procedural guidance. Key issues include improper callout formatting, title-cased headings, and generic link text. Strengths include correct code formatting and logical structure.  

---  

## Detailed Findings  

### Issue 1: Improper Callout Formatting  

- **Location**: Info note under step 1 of "Avoiding errors..."  
- **Current Text**:  

  ```  
  > ℹ️ Replace {desiredWorkspace} with the workspace you want to work in.  
  ```  

- **Recommendation**: Use standardized callout syntax:  

  ```  
  ℹ️ **Information:** Replace `desiredWorkspace` with the workspace you want to work in.  
  ```  

- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 9.1. Callout in flowing text*: "Use ℹ️ **Information**, ⚠️ **Caution**, or ⛔ **Danger** labels."  
- **Rationale**: Blockquote syntax lacks accessibility labels and violates visual consistency rules.  

### Issue 2: Title-Case Headings  

- **Location**: Subheadings "Avoiding errors..." and "Publishing your..."  
- **Current Text**: Title case (e.g., "Avoiding Errors When Installing...").  
- **Recommendation**: Use sentence case: "Avoiding errors when installing..."  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 4. Headings and titles*: "Use sentence case for titles and headings."  
- **Rationale**: Title case conflicts with VTEX’s sentence-case requirement.  

### Issue 3: Generic Link Text  

- **Location**: Links labeled "[link]" and "[install]".  
- **Current Text**: "If your service app is not yet linked or installed, [link](...) or [install](...)."  
- **Recommendation**: Use descriptive text: "If your service app is not yet linked or installed, [link your service app](...) or [install your service app](...)."  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 5.2. Writing link text*: "Write unique, descriptive link text that makes sense without surrounding context."  
- **Rationale**: Generic terms like "link" lack clarity and context.  

### Issue 4: Inconsistent Placeholder Formatting  

- **Location**: CLI command placeholder `{desiredWorkspace}`  
- **Current Text**: Curly braces without code formatting.  
- **Recommendation**: Format as code: `` `desiredWorkspace` ``.  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 8.1. Placeholders*: "Format placeholders as code without curly brackets."  
- **Rationale**: Curly braces are not part of VTEX’s placeholder syntax.  

### Issue 5: Missing Periods in Steps  

- **Location**: Step 3 under "Publishing your configuration app..."  
- **Current Text**: "Create a new version of your configuration app..." (no period).  
- **Recommendation**: Add a period: "Create a new version of your configuration app...".  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 7.1.4. Punctuation*: "End list items with periods if they contain verbs."  
- **Rationale**: Inconsistent punctuation disrupts readability.

## Positive Aspects  

1. **Code Formatting**: CLI commands (e.g., `vtex use workspace`) and flags (`-w`) are correctly formatted.  
2. **Procedural Clarity**: Steps under both solutions are sequential and actionable.  
3. **Link Ownership**: All links point to internal VTEX documentation, adhering to ownership guidelines.

## Recommendations for This Document  

1. **Standardize Callouts**: Replace blockquotes with proper ℹ️/⚠️ labels and structured HTML alerts.  
2. **Revise Headings**: Convert all subsection headings to sentence case.  
3. **Enhance Link Text**: Use descriptive phrases (e.g., "link your service app" instead of "link").

**Final Note**: The document provides valuable troubleshooting guidance but requires adjustments to visual formatting and text clarity for full Style Guide compliance.
