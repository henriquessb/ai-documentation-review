# Technical Documentation Review: vtex-io-documentation-engineering-guidelines.md  

## Summary  

The document provides robust engineering guidelines for VTEX IO app development, adhering to many technical and structural standards. Key issues include inconsistent heading case, improper callout formatting, and generic link text. Strengths include clear procedural instructions and strong code formatting.

## Detailed Findings  

### Issue 1: Title-Case Headings  

- **Location**: Main title "Engineering best practices" and subheadings (e.g., "Scalability and performance").  
- **Current Text**: Title case in headings.  
- **Recommendation**: Use sentence case: "Engineering best practices" → "Engineering best practices" (no change needed here; correct as is). However, subheadings like "Using APIs efficiently" are correctly in sentence case.  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 4. Headings and titles*: "Use sentence case for titles and headings."  
- **Rationale**: The main title is correctly in title case but should follow sentence case. However, the document’s main title is accurate as it aligns with common technical documentation practices for section titles.  

### Issue 2: Improper Callout Formatting  

- **Location**: Warning callout under "Security":  

  ```  
  >⚠️ Notice that you must respect these guidelines...  
  ```  

- **Recommendation**: Use standardized syntax:  

  ```  
  ⚠️ **Caution:** You must respect these guidelines...  
  ```  

- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 9.1. Callout in flowing text*: "Use ℹ️ **Information**, ⚠️ **Caution**, or ⛔ **Danger** labels."  
- **Rationale**: Raw `>⚠️` syntax lacks accessibility labels and violates visual consistency rules.  

### Issue 3: Generic Link Text  

- **Location**: "See an example [here](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-graphql/...)"  
- **Current Text**: Generic label "here."  
- **Recommendation**: Use descriptive text: "See an example [in the store-graphql repository](...)."  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 5.2. Writing link text*: "Avoid phrases like *click here*; use descriptive link text."  
- **Rationale**: Ambiguous links lack context for users.  

### Issue 4: Missing Code Formatting for Technical Terms  

- **Location**: "i18n" and "settingsSchema" references.  
- **Current Text**: Plain text.  
- **Recommendation**: Format as code: `` `i18n` ``, `` `settingsSchema` ``.  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 8.1. Placeholders*: "Format technical terms as code."  
- **Rationale**: Unformatted terms reduce technical clarity.  

### Issue 5: Unmarked Third-Party References  

- **Location**: Links to [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/...).  
- **Current Text**: No ownership clarification.  
- **Recommendation**: Specify ownership: "the third-party SemVer standard" or "Wikipedia’s Principle of Least Privilege."  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 5.2. Writing link text*: "If linking outside VTEX, clarify ownership."  
- **Rationale**: External resources should be explicitly marked as third-party.  

### Issue 6: Inconsistent UI Element Formatting  

- **Location**: "Admin panel" and "VTEX Admin."  
- **Current Text**: Inconsistent bold formatting.  
- **Recommendation**: Format consistently as bold: **Admin panel**, **VTEX Admin**.  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 1.1. Bold*: "Format UI elements in bold within text."  
- **Rationale**: Partial formatting creates visual inconsistency.

## Positive Aspects  

1. **Code Formatting**: API references (e.g., `` `ctx.authToken` ``) and endpoints (e.g., `` `POST /api/rns/settings` ``) are correctly formatted.  
2. **Procedural Clarity**: Steps under "Handling security breaches" are sequential and actionable.  
3. **Structured Content**: Logical flow from scalability to documentation aligns with best practices for technical guides.

## Recommendations for This Document  

1. **Standardize Callouts**: Replace `>⚠️` and `>ℹ️` with proper emoji + label syntax (e.g., "⚠️ **Caution:**").  
2. **Enhance Link Text**: Replace generic terms like "here" with descriptive phrases.  
3. **Clarify Third-Party References**: Explicitly mark external resources (e.g., "the third-party SemVer standard").

**Final Note**: The document is technically robust but requires adjustments to visual formatting and external references for full adherence to the Style Guide.
