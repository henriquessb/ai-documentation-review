# Technical Documentation Review: 2024-12-23-faststore-improvements.md  

## Summary  

The document effectively communicates performance improvements for FastStore, with clear structure and adherence to many Style Guide rules (e.g., code formatting, numbered procedures). Key issues include inconsistent heading formatting, missing callouts for experimental features, and minor punctuation/style deviations.  

---  

## Detailed Findings  

### Issue 1: Parentheses in Headings  

- **Location**: "### Preact (experimental feature)"  
- **Current Text**: `Preact (experimental feature)`  
- **Recommendation**: Replace parentheses with an em dash: `Preact – experimental feature`  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 4. Headings and titles*: "Do not use highlight expressions and generic words for headings [...] such as *attention, details, important observations*."  
- **Rationale**: Parentheses introduce informal punctuation to headings. The em dash maintains professionalism while separating the qualifier.  

### Issue 2: Missing Beta/Experimental Callout  

- **Location**: Preact section  
- **Current Text**: No callout for experimental feature.  
- **Recommendation**: Add a beta phase callout at the start of the Preact section:  

  ```  
  ⚠️ **Caution:** Preact support is experimental. Test thoroughly before enabling in production.  
  ```  

- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 9.2. Beta phase*: "Use beta phase warnings at the beginning of articles about products in beta."  
- **Rationale**: Experimental features require clear warnings to prevent unintended issues.  

### Issue 3: Unclear External Link Ownership  

- **Location**: "[Improving store performance with Preact](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/managing-performance-improving-store-performance-with-preact)"  
- **Current Text**: No mention of VTEX ownership.  
- **Recommendation**: Specify ownership: "See the VTEX guide [Improving store performance with Preact](...)."  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 5.2. Writing link text*: "If you're linking to a document outside VTEX, be explicit about who it belongs to."  
- **Rationale**: Clarifies the source, improving trust and navigation.  

### Issue 4: Colon in Title  

- **Location**: Title  
- **Current Text**: `FastStore: Performance improvements for mobile devices`  
- **Recommendation**: Remove the colon: `FastStore performance improvements for mobile devices`  
- **Applicable Guideline**: *Section 4. Headings and titles*: "Your heading or title must [...] be descriptive, as short as possible [...] Do not use punctuation at the end."  
- **Rationale**: Colons are discouraged unless essential for clarity. The title remains clear without it.

## Positive Aspects  

1. **Procedures**: Steps under "What needs to be done?" are sequential, actionable, and use proper code formatting for commands.  
2. **Lists**: Bullet points under "Optimizing website load times" follow Style Guide rules (bolded concepts, parallel structure).  
3. **Code Formatting**: Placeholders like `3.0.112` and code blocks for terminal commands are correctly formatted.

## Recommendations for This Document  

1. **Add Callouts**: Use beta/experimental warnings for Preact to emphasize its tentative status.  
2. **Revise Headings**: Remove parentheses and colons to align with Style Guide punctuation rules.  
3. **Clarify Links**: Explicitly state ownership of external resources (e.g., "VTEX guide").

**Final Note**: The document successfully details technical improvements but would benefit from stronger adherence to visual emphasis and punctuation guidelines.
