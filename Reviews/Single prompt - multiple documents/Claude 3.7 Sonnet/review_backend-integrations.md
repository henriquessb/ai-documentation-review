## Summary
This document provides comprehensive information about backend integrations for VTEX stores. The content is well-structured with clear headings and logical organization. However, there are several issues with formatting consistency, particularly with links, callouts, and some punctuation that should be addressed to improve readability and adherence to the style guide.

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1
- **Location**: Throughout the document
- **Current Text**: Multiple instances of links without proper spacing, e.g., "platform[resources]" in the Developing integrations section
- **Recommendation**: Add spaces between words and links throughout the document.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 5.3 Punctuation with links - "If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags."
- **Rationale**: Proper spacing between words and links improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 2
- **Location**: Multiple tables throughout the document
- **Current Text**: Tables with varying formats and inconsistent cell content formatting
- **Recommendation**: Standardize table formatting and ensure consistent use of formatting within table cells.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 7.2 Tables - "Tables must have an introductory sentence describing their purpose."
- **Rationale**: Consistent table formatting improves readability and makes information easier to scan.

### Issue 3
- **Location**: Callout divs throughout the document
- **Current Text**: 
```html
<div class="alert alert-warning">
When importing categories from external software, the category structure in the software may differ from that of VTEX. In this case, we recommend creating an inactive "mock" category. This category will remain invisible on the storefront and serve as a temporary repository to receive all products and SKUs during the import process. Once the import is complete, you can manually organize the products within the VTEX Admin to match the desired category tree.
</div>
```
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all callouts follow the style guide format with proper HTML tags for text formatting inside callouts.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 9.5 Formatting callouts - "For text formatting inside callouts, use HTML tags: Bold: `<strong>text</strong>`, Italic: `<em>text</em>`, Links: `<a href="URL">link text</a>`"
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of callouts improves readability and accessibility.

### Issue 4
- **Location**: Initial setup section, numbered list
- **Current Text**: 
```
1. [Catalog architecture](#catalog-architecture)

  a. Category tree

  b. Brands

  c. Specifications (groups and fields)
```
- **Recommendation**: Use proper formatting for sub-steps in numbered procedures with letters for sub-steps.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 6.3 Sub-steps in numbered procedures - "Use letters for sub-steps and Roman numerals for sub-sub-steps."
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of procedures with sub-steps improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 5
- **Location**: "Before creating an app for your store" section
- **Current Text**: "...the team or agency will also be responsible for maintaining and updating the app."
- **Recommendation**: Avoid using "will" for future tense and use present tense instead.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 3.1.4 Tense - "In general, use verbs in the present tense."
- **Rationale**: Using present tense for technical documentation provides clarity and immediacy.

### Issue 6
- **Location**: "Extensions and apps" section
- **Current Text**: "One way to add new features to the VTEX platform is by creating apps using [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io), our development platform that provides high-performance management, scalability, and robust security."
- **Recommendation**: Avoid using first-person pronouns like "our" and rephrase to be more neutral.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 10.3 Documenting Design Systems - "Avoid parentheses, personal pronouns, and mentions to users"
- **Rationale**: Using neutral language maintains a professional tone and avoids confusion about the author's perspective.
