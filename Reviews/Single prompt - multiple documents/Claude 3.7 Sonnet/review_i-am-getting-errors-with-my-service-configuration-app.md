## Summary
This document provides solutions for errors encountered when developing service configuration apps. The content is well-structured with clear headings and logical organization. However, there are several inconsistencies with the style guide, particularly in the formatting of callouts, code blocks, and placeholders that should be addressed to improve readability and adherence to the style guide.

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1
- **Location**: First solution, step 1 callout
- **Current Text**: "> ℹ️ Replace {desiredWorkspace} with the workspace you want to work in."
- **Recommendation**: Replace the Markdown blockquote with the proper HTML div format for an information callout.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 9.5 Formatting callouts - "Callouts use HTML `<div>` tags with Bootstrap CSS classes"
- **Rationale**: Using the proper callout format ensures consistent styling and accessibility across all documentation.

### Issue 2
- **Location**: First solution, step 1
- **Current Text**: "```\nvtex use workspace {desiredWorkspace}\n```"
- **Recommendation**: Specify the language for the code block (bash or shell) to enable proper syntax highlighting.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.2 Button names - "When referring to names for buttons in a list or numbered procedure or bulleted list, format the button name as code."
- **Rationale**: Specifying the language for code blocks improves readability and enables proper syntax highlighting.

### Issue 3
- **Location**: First solution, step 1 callout
- **Current Text**: "Replace {desiredWorkspace} with the workspace you want to work in."
- **Recommendation**: Format the placeholder consistently using code formatting without curly brackets in flowing text.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.1 Placeholders - "When mentioning a placeholder in a flowing text, format it as code without the curly brackets."
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of placeholders improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 4
- **Location**: Second solution, step 1
- **Current Text**: "Replace `{desiredWorkspace}` with the workspace you want to work in."
- **Recommendation**: Format the placeholder consistently using code formatting without curly brackets in flowing text.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.1 Placeholders - "When mentioning a placeholder in a flowing text, format it as code without the curly brackets."
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of placeholders improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 5
- **Location**: Second solution, step 4
- **Current Text**: "```\nvtex publish -w {desiredWorkspace}\n```"
- **Recommendation**: Specify the language for the code block (bash or shell) to enable proper syntax highlighting.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.2 Button names - "When referring to names for buttons in a list or numbered procedure or bulleted list, format the button name as code."
- **Rationale**: Specifying the language for code blocks improves readability and enables proper syntax highlighting.

### Issue 6
- **Location**: Throughout the document
- **Current Text**: Multiple links to other documentation pages
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding brief explanations of what the linked resources contain to provide more context.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 5.2 Writing link text - "If the link text doesn't clearly indicate why you're referring the reader to this information, then give an explanation."
- **Rationale**: Providing context for linked resources helps users understand why they should follow the links.
