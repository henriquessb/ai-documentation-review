## Summary
This document provides a comprehensive overview of authentication methods in VTEX. The content is well-structured and generally follows the style guide. However, there are several formatting inconsistencies, particularly with links, button formatting, and spacing issues that should be addressed to improve readability and adherence to the style guide.

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1
- **Location**: Developing integrations section, bullet points
- **Current Text**: "* **Application keys (appKeys):** [Application keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet) authenticate requests made to VTEX APIs. Store admins can create keys and associate them with [roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc), allowing them to use certain platform[resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3)."
- **Recommendation**: Add a space between "platform" and the link to "resources".
- **Applicable Guideline**: 5.3 Punctuation with links - "If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags."
- **Rationale**: Proper spacing between words and links improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 2
- **Location**: Developing integrations section, bullet points
- **Current Text**: "* **User tokens:** User tokens authenticate API requests, especially for[frontend](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/store-development--3fHF3GIjK8UugnQKIakpl9/5DTcawNjc5MovtD7HNqURl) applications developed with VTEX IO."
- **Recommendation**: Add a space between "for" and the link to "frontend".
- **Applicable Guideline**: 5.3 Punctuation with links - "If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags."
- **Rationale**: Proper spacing between words and links improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 3
- **Location**: Enforcing password expiration section, step 4
- **Current Text**: "4. In the **Password** row, click`Edit`."
- **Recommendation**: Add a space between "click" and the code-formatted button name: "click `Edit`."
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.2 Button names - "When referring to names for buttons in a list or numbered procedure or bulleted list, format the button name as code."
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of button names with proper spacing improves readability.

### Issue 4
- **Location**: Enforcing password expiration section, step 7
- **Current Text**: "7. Click `Save`."
- **Recommendation**: Maintain consistent formatting for button names in procedures.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.2 Button names - "When referring to names for buttons in a list or numbered procedure or bulleted list, format the button name as code."
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of UI elements improves readability and user experience.

### Issue 5
- **Location**: Alert warning div
- **Current Text**: "You must have a valid admin <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-users--tutorials_512">user</a> to log in to the VTEX Admin. The <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc">roles</a> and permissions assigned to the user specify which<a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3"> resources</a> they can use in the Admin."
- **Recommendation**: Add a space between "which" and the link to "resources".
- **Applicable Guideline**: 5.3 Punctuation with links - "If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags."
- **Rationale**: Proper spacing between words and links improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 6
- **Location**: Login section, table
- **Current Text**: The table uses "Can be enabled" and "Always enabled" repeatedly.
- **Recommendation**: Consider using icons or a more concise representation for availability status in the table.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 7.2 Tables - "Tables must have an introductory sentence describing their purpose."
- **Rationale**: More concise representation in tables improves readability and reduces repetition.
