## Summary
This document effectively communicates FastStore performance improvements for mobile devices. It follows most style guide rules with a clear structure and appropriate formatting. However, there are a few issues with punctuation, formatting of computer interfaces, and some inconsistencies in capitalization that could be improved.

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1
- **Location**: Title and first paragraph
- **Current Text**: "FastStore: Performance improvements for mobile devices" and "FastStore has undergone significant optimizations to improve mobile performance, achieving a Lighthouse score improvement from 64 to 95."
- **Recommendation**: Ensure consistent capitalization of product names by using "VTEX FastStore" instead of just "FastStore" when referring to the product.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 3.4 Official names - "Follow VTEX's specific capitalization rules for product names"
- **Rationale**: Consistent product naming helps maintain brand identity and avoids confusion for readers.

### Issue 2
- **Location**: Code block in "What needs to be done?" section
- **Current Text**: 
```bash
yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
```
- **Recommendation**: Add a brief explanation of what this command does and what users should expect to see after running it.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 6.2 Content - "Each line of the procedure must correspond to an action to be taken by the user" and "State the purpose and location before declaring the action."
- **Rationale**: Providing context for command-line instructions helps users understand what they're doing and what to expect.

### Issue 3
- **Location**: "Preact (experimental feature)" section
- **Current Text**: "After updating your FastStore project version to `3.0.112` or later, see the [Improving store performance with Preact](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/managing-performance-improving-store-performance-with-preact) guide to enable Preact."
- **Recommendation**: Format the version number as code without backticks since it's in a flowing text.
- **Applicable Guideline**: 8.1 Placeholders - "When mentioning a placeholder in a flowing text, format it as code without the curly brackets."
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting of technical elements improves readability and follows the style guide.

### Issue 4

- **Location**: "Optimizing website load times" section
- **Current Text**: "Using [next/dynamic](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading#nextdynamic) to load components efficiently..."
- **Recommendation**: Format "next/dynamic" as code within the link text.
