## Executive Summary

The documentation suite generally provides valuable and informative content. However, there are consistent issues across multiple documents that need to be addressed to improve adherence to the E&D Style Guide. Common problems include inconsistent formatting, incorrect link text, use of informal language, and non-standard callout implementation. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the overall quality, clarity, and professionalism of the documentation.

## Common Issues

1. **Incorrect Link Text**: A prevalent issue is the improper formatting of link text. The prescribed format "*For more information, see...*" is often not followed.
2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: There's inconsistency in the use of bold text for UI elements and code formatting for code-related terms.
3. **Improper Callout Implementation**: Many documents use `<div>` tags with Bootstrap CSS classes instead of the standard callout format with appropriate icons.
4. **Non-Actionable or Generic Headings**: Headings are frequently generic or phrased as questions rather than actionable statements.
5. **Informal Language**: Some documents contain instances of informal language, including personal pronouns ("we," "you") and subjective adjectives ("easy," "simple").

5. **Eliminate Informal Language**: Remove personal pronouns ("we," "you") and subjective adjectives ("easy," "simple") to maintain a professional and objective tone.
