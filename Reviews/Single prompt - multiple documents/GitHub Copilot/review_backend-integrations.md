## Summary
The document provides comprehensive coverage of VTEX's backend integration options and processes. It is well-structured with clear sections covering different integration types. While generally adhering to style guidelines, there are opportunities for improvement in formatting and organization of complex information.

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1
- **Location**: Nested lists in Initial setup section
- **Current Text**: Multiple levels of nested numbered lists (1, a, b, c)
- **Recommendation**: Restructure nested lists using a different format, such as bullet points for sub-items or separate sections with clear headings
- **Applicable Guideline**: Section 7.1 - Lists: "Use bullet lists for items with no particular order"
- **Rationale**: Deep nesting makes the content harder to read and navigate

### Issue 2
- **Location**: Alert div formatting throughout document
- **Current Text**: 
```html
<div class="alert alert-warning">
When importing categories from external software...
</div>
```
- **Recommendation**: Use the standardized callout format with appropriate icons as specified in the style guide
- **Applicable Guideline**: Section 9.1 - "There are three kinds of callouts to highlight information"
- **Rationale**: Callouts should follow the style guide's standardized format for consistency

### Issue 3
- **Location**: Image references
- **Current Text**: `![ERP-integrations-en](//images.ctfassets.net/...)`
- **Recommendation**: Add more descriptive alt text and ensure proper image path formatting
- **Applicable Guideline**: Style Guide section on image accessibility
- **Rationale**: Better alt text improves accessibility and SEO
