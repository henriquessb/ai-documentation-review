### Issue 1
- **Location**: Title metadata
- **Current Text**: `title: "FastStore: Performance improvements for mobile devices"`
- **Recommendation**: Remove quotes from the title metadata

- **Recommendation**: Replace with direct link to the section: "After updating your FastStore project version (see 'What needs to be done' below)"
- **Applicable Guideline**: Section 5.1 - Links should be descriptive and make sense without surrounding text
- **Rationale**: Internal anchor links should be replaced with descriptive text for better readability

### Issue 3

yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
```
- **Recommendation**: Add explanation of the command's effects before the code block
