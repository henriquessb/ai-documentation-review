## Summary
The document effectively presents frequently asked questions about VTEX's Subscriptions feature. While the content is informative and well-organized, there are opportunities to improve the formatting and structure to better align with the style guide.

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1
- **Location**: Heading hierarchy
- **Current Text**: Multiple H3 headings (`###`) for questions without H2 sections
- **Recommendation**: Group related questions under H2 topic sections, with questions as H3 headings
- **Applicable Guideline**: Style Guide FAQ Templates section - "Multiple topics FAQ" format
- **Rationale**: Better organization and navigation through logical grouping of related questions

### Issue 2
- **Location**: Technical term emphasis
- **Current Text**: "_Minimum total value in cart_" with underscores
- **Recommendation**: Use bold formatting for UI elements: "**Minimum total value in cart**"
- **Applicable Guideline**: Section 1.1 - "The bold type formatting should be used whenever mentioning computer interfaces"
- **Rationale**: Maintain consistent formatting for UI element references

### Issue 3
- **Location**: Time zone reference
- **Current Text**: "6:00 and 7:00 am in Brazil zone (GMT-3)"
- **Recommendation**: Use 24-hour format and standardize time zone reference: "06:00-07:00 UTC-3"
- **Applicable Guideline**: Style Guide section on formatting times and dates
- **Rationale**: Use consistent and unambiguous time formats across documentation
