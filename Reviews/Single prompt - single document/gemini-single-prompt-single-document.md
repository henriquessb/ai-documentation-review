Okay, I've analyzed the "vtex-io-documentation-engineering-guidelines.txt" file and will provide recommendations based on the "E&D Style Guide.txt."

Here are the suggested edits and the reasoning behind them, referencing specific rules from the Style Guide:

**General Observations:**

10. **Declaring broad policies**
    *   **Original:** `Outbound access policies (`outbound-access`) to VTEX resources should follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). In short, you only give access to what is really needed.`
    *   **Proposed:** `Outbound access policies (`outbound-access`) to VTEX resources should follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). Give access only to what is really needed.`
    *   **Reasoning:** Style Guide -> 3.1 Voice: Use active voice instead of passive voice.

    *   **Original:** `Ensure that all messages are [internationalized](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-multi-language-stores#storefront-content-internationalization) using the messages builder. Also, i18n keys should start with the domain (`store/` for storefront and `admin/` for Admin) where they are used. Otherwise, they will not render properly. For more information, see our reference for translating components.`
