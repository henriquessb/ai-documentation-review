Here\u0027s a summary of its key points:\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n*   **Clarity and Consistency:** The guide aims to ensure VTEX documentation is easy to understand and follows a consistent style.\n*   **VTEX\u0027s Declaration:** The guide is VTEX\u0027s interpretation of language use for technical and functional content about the VTEX platform.\n*   **Best Practices:** It serves as a reference for technical writers, not a rigid regulation, to improve content.\n*   **Iterative Process:** Content creation involves multiple reviews and revisions.\n\n**Reference Hierarchy:**\n\n1.  **This Style Guide:** Primary source.\n2.  **Third-Party References:** GrammarBook.com (English grammar), Gramaticaonline.com.br (Portuguese grammar), Merriam-Webster.com (English spelling), and Dicio.com.br (Portuguese spelling).\n\n**Key Editorial Guidelines:**\n\n*   **Word Emphasis:**\n    *   **Bold:** Computer interfaces, concepts in bulleted lists, punctuation after bolded words.\n    *   **Italic:** Specific words/phrases, foreign language terms, mathematical variables and version variables.\n    *   **Underline:**  Reserved for links only.\n*   **Numbers and Currency:** Spell out ordinal numbers, numbers zero to nine, and numbers at the beginning of a sentence. Use numerals for numbers 10 or greater, measurements, percentages, etc. Use ISO 4217 currency codes (e.g., USD) with the dollar sign ($) at the beginning and commas for thousands separators and periods for decimals in USD.\n*   **Capitalization:**\n    *   Sentence case for titles, headings, lists, and table elements.\n    *   All-uppercase for official names, abbreviations, and codes.\n    *   Camel-cased for placeholders and developer fields.\n*   **Headings and Titles:** Descriptive, short, sentence case, no punctuation, start with a verb in infinitive form or a noun, and follow heading hierarchy.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Match link text to the title, describe the destination, or link to isolated words referring to a concept or definition.\n    *   Use phrases like \"For more information, see...\"\n    *   Be descriptive and avoid \"click here.\"\n    *   Indicate file downloads.\n    *   Punctuation outside of link tags.\n*   **Procedures:**\n    *   Introductory sentences for context.\n    *   Each step is an action for the user.\n    *   Consistent tense.\n    *   Reproduce UI text exactly.\n    *   Sub-steps use letters or Roman numerals.\n*   **Lists and Tables:**\n    *   Use lists for single units, tables for paired or multiple related data.\n    *   Introductory sentences for context.\n    *   Parallel structure in lists.\n    *   Consistent punctuation.\n*   **Computer Interfaces:**\n    *   Placeholders in curly brackets `{}` (but use code formatting without brackets in flowing text).\n    *   Button names in code formatting in lists.\n    *   UI element sequences with angle brackets in bold.\n    *   Include labels for icons to improve accessibility.\n*   **Callouts:**\n    *   Information (ℹ️), Caution (⚠️), Danger (⛔).\n    *   Concise, not at the beginning, and not too close together.\n*   **Learn More Section:**\n    *   Related articles either in the middle or at the end.\n\n**Announcement Framework:**\n\n*   **Goals:** Clear, Suitable, Precise, Correct.\n*   **Structure:** Title, Introduction (what, who, why), Main Content (what\u0027s changing, when, how it affects, actions), Call to Action.\n\n**Other:**\n\n*   FAQ templates\n*   Terms Reference: VTEX UX Writing Word List\n*   User Documentation Template\n*   UX Writing Guidelines: Pragmatics, Semantics, Morphology, Spelling, Punctuation.\n\n**UX Writing Guidelines Details:**\n\n*   **Pragmatics:** Direct, informative, clear, and concise language for an identified audience. Focus on brand voice and appropriate tone.\n*   **Semantics:** Clear conceptions (product, feature, etc.), gender-neutral language, and global context.\n*   **Morphology:** Simple verbs, active voice, second person, present tense. Avoid gender-specific pronouns and subjective adjectives.\n*   **Spelling:** Consistent terminology (refer to the terms reference).\n*   **Punctuation:** Avoid exclamation points, never use parentheses for entire sentences, use straight quotation marks, and brackets to insert something into a sentence already in parentheses. Place the period outside the closing parenthesis.\n",
